1. Preheat oven to a moderate 180Â°C 
2. Put the softened (at room temperature) butter and sugar into a bowl of a stand mixer and beat at medium until light and fluffy using the [creaming method].
3. Break the eggs into a bowl to avoid any shells being added to the mix.
4. Add the vanilla and eggs (one at a time form the bowl) mixing on medium-high until incorporated and light.
5. Sift the flour and cocoa together into a bowl.
6. Add the sifted flour and cocoa alternately with the milk to the mixer until combined, making sure to turn the speed down to low to avoid any flour from leaving the bowl.
7. Line a muffin pan with 12 x 1/3 cup capacity patty papers.
8. Bake for 20 minutes or until a skewer inserted into the middle comes out clean.
9. Cool on a wire rack for 10 minutes before turning out of pan to cool completely.
10. Decorate the cakes with chocolate icing. Allow the icing to set before serving.
